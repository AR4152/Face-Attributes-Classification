# Face-Attributes-Classification

Celebrities often define fashion trends and standards by the styles they choose. To address a rapidly changing demand, designers need to be able to automatically identify trends. The model uses a large database of celebrity images to find trends and facial attributes among such images.

a) Wearing Accessories
